**Communications and Digital Culture student at the University of Essex**  

Hello! My name is Connor Peters. 

I am a student at the University of Essex studying Communications and Digital Culture. After studying Media Studies at A-Level, I worked for 2 years as a customer advisor at B&Q and as an administrative assisstant for HMCTS in South West London before deciding to enrol into a foundation year at university which lead me to study this degree. In the past I have been interested in editing videos and images and closely followed video game culture and esports. Now I am interested in media sociology and sociology in general, whilst also striving to maintain an apt knowledge of the lastest forms of technology and seeking to understand where technology may take us in the future.
