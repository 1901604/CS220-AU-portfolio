## Reflection on digital identities

This writing briefly reflects on my understanding of:

- digital identities in general
- my digital identities in the past/present
- my digital identities in the future

### Digital identities

In 2001, Prensky introduced the terms digital native and digital immigrant. Prensky argued that current students, the digital natives, have been immersed in technology all their lives and developed technical skills and learning preferences that do not adhere with traditional methods. Therefore, the younger generation's use of Information and Communication Technologies separates them from the older generation, who are digital immigrants (Prensky, 2001). More recently, instead of this model, White et al (2009) proposed a Visitors and Residents model. This model is comprised of people being at some point across a continuum rather than the binary opposition of two categories first put forth by Prensky. In this model, a predominantly Visitor approach is not necessarily any less effective or valuable than a predominantly Resident approach as it will vary depending on context and aims. Additionally, the Visitor is not necessarily any less technically adept than the Resident. Technical aptitude should instead be viewed as extending into skill sets necessary for different disciplines instead of simply the ability to manipulate hardware and software. 

To help identify and improve my digital identities, I explored [White et al.'s Visitor and Resident (V&R) concept](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) which describes how the Visitors and Residents concept is a simple way of presenting the range of ways people can engage with the Web. Out of this, I found it interesting to evoke more thought regarding the different ways in which myself and others use the internet and more about how the footprint we leave varies depending on which of these visitor or resident modes we occupy. It is not just older people who should learn how to use the Web. The complexity means that all ages should educate themselves.

In the V&R map, 'visitors' are unlikely to own an online profile that projects their identity into the digital space. They are anonymous and their activity is only visible to the databases behind the Websites they are using. When in Visitor mode, individuals decide on the task they wish to undertake, complete their task and then go offline or move on to another task. In Visitor mode, individuals do not leave any social trace online. On the other hand, 'residents' use the Web as a place to meet friends and share information about their life. A segment of their lives is lived online where the difference between online and offâ€“line is increasingly blurred. Residents have profiles in social networking platforms where they comfortably express themselves. Their residency is an additional layer of interaction as they often also carry out the same actions as 'visitors'. This type of online behaviour leaves a persistent social trace (White & Cornu, 2011).

Since my first device, there has been a drastic change in the way that I use digital technology. Being born in 1999, the earliest years of my life contained very little use of digital technologies. My first memories include watching television, using VHS tapes and gaming on devices such as the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS where I played without internet access. Now, I use my iPhone with multiple apps being used for hours every day, as well as using my MacBook to browse the Web, complete my university work, and watch video content online.

In my personal life, generally my older family members do not use technology as much as me and my sister and cousins for example. I expect that this is because my generation has largely grown up being surrounded by technology so thus have a better understanding of how to use it and it is more engrained into our culture to use it more often. However, almost everyone in England will use digital technology in some form and all members of my family and friends have smartphones, computers and internet access that they use in their daily lives. From personal experience, my Grandad is 82 years old and some of his use of technology is to manage investments online and for emails rather than newer forms of social media common for my generation. In some sense, this diminished usage may be more efficient in that less time is spent on unnecessary scrolling on social media and instead the technology is used more for professional means. This relationship with technology may have been shifted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic where, for instance, my mum had to use Zoom for work meetings which she had not done before. 

Critical thinking is an increasingly important concept in the digital realm as children and adults must be able to evaluate online content and recognise how this exposure and online interaction can affect behaviour, emotions, and beliefs. It can aid in building resilience to online risks such as self-esteem and body image issues from advertising and celebrity culture, as well as exposure to propaganda, fake news, and extremist content. When assessing information found online, it is important to question who posted the content, if they are reliable or biased, and if the content could be edited or fake, as well as what the desired outcome was (Cawthorne, 2017).

### My present digital identities

Using the V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo/diagram below).

<br><br>

To clarify:

- in my visiting mode, the primary activities are searching, email and Netflix.
- in my resident mode, the primary activities are Twitter and Blogger.
- the difference between my personal and institutional modes is that at this point in my career, my usage is in the personal sphere. This may change over time as I am currently a student and institutional usage may become more prevalent and I transition my focus more onto working and use the Web to aid my development in this.

### My future digital identity/identities

To help develop my digital identities I have:
- revised my current use of digital identities by giving it some critical thought.
- discussed the concept of digital identities and what makes for an improved version with my classmates.
- done online research for what makes a good professional online identity. I found that amongst other aspects, in order to be visible, professional and take control of my digital identity I should have simple usernames such as @ConnorPeters, use a clear and professional profile picture of me, include a short and relevant bio, be active, create an 'About Me' page and delete or private any unwanted past posts that do not align with my desired professional digital identity. 

<br>
I believe that some of the positive aspects of my digital identity thus far include that I have professional accounts such as LinkedIn which present my education and employment history and allow for possible connections to be made for future employment. I have also been cautious with what I post on social media in the past and have recently deleted some content I now deem inappropriate. Some of my social media such as Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat are on private, and I have effectively used sites such as eBay to buy and sell products and have good reviews. Additionally, some of my Media Studies content from A-Levels can be accessed on a public Blogger account. Furthermore, I have used an alias in the past for gaming accounts which separates them from my professional identity, and I have posted YouTube videos displaying my academic work to an account in my name and recreational work has been posted to an account with an alias.

#### Objectives

The above V&R map and its analysis highlighted that a large majority of my digital identity footprint fell into the 'personal' category and was slightly more weighted towards the 'visitor' category too. After identifying and analysing my current use of digital identities on the Web, I set the goal to continue to keep my LinkedIn and bio up-to-date and accurate, continue to be wary of what I post to public accounts however to be more active for relevant and interesting content such as Blogger or Twitter. Additionally, I wish to follow more accounts on Twitter that align with my professional interests and to reply and interact with these posts more in the effort of making more connections and to be more engaged and integrated into the space. As well as this, I will watch YouTube videos and read more web articles to search for any other aspects that make a good professional identity that I am missing. I aim to produce more interesting content in video format that can be uploaded to YouTube in an account in my name to reach a wider audience, generate a portfolio of my work and create more interest and connections. I should also use a new email address to separate my personal and professional accounts.

By addressing these objectives my V&R map will look as follows:

### Summary

In this writing I reflected on my understanding of digital identities in general and highlighted how we have developed on Prensky's model of digital natives and digital immigrants to give White et al's Visitors and Reisidents model which gives a more accurate spectrum for people to be placed on. I also outlined how my present digital identities mostly occupy the 'personal' category, and how in the future I aim to have much more weighting in the 'professional' and 'resident' sectors in order to have a more efficient and useful digital identity.
